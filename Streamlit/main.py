The little droplets huddled together, shivering, and turned into tiny water droplets. These droplets bumped into each other and joined together, forming fluffy white clouds. "Look, Pooh!" cried Piglet, pointing to the sky. "Those clouds look like big puffs of cotton candy!"

# The clouds grew bigger and bigger as more and more water droplets joined them. Soon, they were so heavy they couldn't hold any more water. The water began to fall from the sky as raindrops. "Oh, bother," grumbled Pooh as he felt the first drops on his head. "Now we'll get all wet!" But Piglet squealed with delight and started jumping in the puddles. "This is fun, Pooh!" he cried.

# The rain fell and fell, filling the river to the brim. Some of the water soaked into the ground, and some flowed back into the river. The raindrops even collected in Piglet's bucket! "Look, Pooh!" he exclaimed. "Now I have enough water to build a proper sandcastle moat!" Pooh smiled. "That's wonderful, Piglet," he said. "And when the sun comes out again, the water will go back up to the sky, and the whole thing will start all over again."""""
